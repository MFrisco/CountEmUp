# CountEmUp
# A web app for learning how to count money
# Once in the game, click the white button to generate a random amount
# Use the coins and bills to match the randomly generated dollar amount
#
# FUTURE PLANS:
# A timer so users can improve their money counting speed
# Implement a database so users can store their top speed
# Add another game mode for "making change", (ex:  bill is $27.10 and someone pays with $50, what is the change?)
